# split_prep_paradox
Code designed for finding and verifying split-prep paradoxes

Cases in which a direct preparation P2 is operationally indistinguishable from a preparation P1 followed by a transformation T (so that the final statistics coincide), yet adding the transformational layer renders a noncontextual model impossible even though the underlying PM statistics remain noncontextual.
